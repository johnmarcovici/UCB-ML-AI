Complete Stocks Historical Dataset

NOTE: Only intraday-bars with trading volume are included. Bars with zero volume are excluded.

Timeframes : 1-minute, 5-minutes, 30-minutes, 1-hour, 1-day


Adjustments
------------

We provide three types of data:
Unadjusted - actual historic traded prices with no adjustments (only the 1-minute and 1-day timeframes are available for unadjusted data)
Split Adjusted - prices adjusted for stock splits and reverse splits only
Split+Dividend Adjusted - prices adjusted for both splits and dividends

More details on the adjustment process is at https://firstratedata.com/about/price_adjustment


Format
-------
Data is in the format : { DateTime (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss), Open, High, Low, Close, Volume}  

- Volume Numbers are in individual shares
- Timestamps run from the start of the period (eg 1min bars stamped 09:30 run from 09:30.00 to 09:30.59)
- Times with zero volume are omitted (thus gaps in the data sequence are when there have been no trades)


Updates
-------
This dataset is updated daily (update files are available by 11.45pm US Eastern time and 3am the following day for the full historical archive files) .

New tickers are added at the end of every week.
